        <h2>Game explanation :</h2>
        <p>The game of Web speed is based on fast-thinking and self-improvement through playing, at your disposal are a set of templates (from beginners to advanced challenges) and 2 deck of cards for each team (HTML/CSS).</p>
        <p>This game shall teach you basic HTML/CSS architectures and ways of organizing code.</p>
        <p>Teams are made-up of two people one in charge of the CSS deck and the other in charge of the HTML deck, the goal is to analyze and recreate the template that will be shown to all teams.</p>
        <h2>Course of the game :</h2>
        <p>After a template card was selected the two teams can begin analysing what they will have to put and where and also organizing themselves to begin the puzzle, the player in charge of the HTML cards has to put down on their blank template sheet the different HTML tags and the player in charge of the CSS must place the right style on each HTML card.</p>
        <p>The first team to successfully complete the template card wins a round, first team to five rounds wins the game.</p>
        <p>If upon inspection by the other teams the first team to finish the template has an error in there architecture, everybody except said team wins the round.</p>

        <h2>The HTML deck :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> div = Basic HTML container, easily maleable hence it's popularity</li>
            <li> header = an HTML element that represents introductory content, usually navigational aids.</li>
            <li> footer = an HTML element that represents the last ontainer of a web page, usually navigational aids</li>
            <li> h1 = an HTML heading, that serves as a title holder (h2, h3, h4, etc... also exists)</li>
            <li> p =  a paragraph container, used to display text onto the web page</li>
            <li> ul =  an HTML container meant to display list items</li>
            <li> li = HTML element that is an item within a list</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The CSS deck :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>background-color =  changes the background color of the container on wich it stands</li>
            <li>color = changes the color of the text on wich it stands</li>
            <li>font-family = changes the font family (arial, open sans, etc) of the text on wich it stands</li>
            <li>text-transform = CSS property that allow to transform text in many ways </li>
        </ul>
        <p>about custom selectors = you maybe have stumbled upon a card using a ">p" or ">h1" before the css content,, it is a way of telling the navigator to apply the style to the first paragraph or heading1 they see within the container on wich the style is placed</p>
